## Outcomes per strategy

| Strategy | Detected | Not said | FNR | FPR | via Exact | via Semantic | Semantic lift |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| apple_speech_transcriber | 93 | 21 | 18.4% | 0.0% | 93 | 0 | — |

_**Not said** = cue was expected but dealer never said it — coaching finding, not an engine error._ _**Semantic lift** = extra cues caught only by the embedding layer._

## Engine performance metrics

Thresholds from telemetry doc: TTFT good <300 ms · TTFC good <500 ms · RTF <1.0 = faster than real-time

| Strategy | TTFT P50 (ms) | TTFT P95 (ms) | TTFinal P50 (ms) | TTFinal P95 (ms) | TTFC P50 (ms) | TTFC P95 (ms) | RTF avg | RTF P95 | Partials/file | Finals/file | Events/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| apple_speech_transcriber | 54 | 138 | 147 | 273 | 280 | 1981 | 0.01 | 0.02 | 4729 | 290 | 4.8 |

## Detection latency per strategy

_Wall-clock time from audio start to each cue detection event._

| Strategy | Count | P50 (ms) | P95 (ms) | P99 (ms) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| apple_speech_transcriber | 2384 | 4917 | 18828 | 22379 |

## Timing breakdown per strategy

_Average wall-clock per phase, per file._

| Strategy | Transcription (ms) | Matching (ms) | Classification (ms) | Total (ms) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| apple_speech_transcriber | 13404.8 | 150.3 | 0.1 | 13555.1 |
